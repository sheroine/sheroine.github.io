            Leap of Faith is a tabletop game prototype about amphibians at the end of the world competing against each other to run the best cult of them all. In hopes that their god would be appeased and spare their little souls from the impending doom on Earth. 
            <br>
            It is an engine builder card game, where players would compete and build their own cult that would generate vast amounts of resources, be it fly tokens to get rich, or followers to perform seances for more self benefits or hinder other players.
            <br>

                <h4>More about the game</h4>
                <p>
                  The manufactured prototype version of this game was done in roughly 2 months as a class project. We took inspiration from Wingspan and decided to make an engine builder game, with aims to make it more interactive between players than Wingspan does, especially between turns. Why frogs and cults though? Well frogs are cool, and cults are... cults. They're fun when it's a game and you get to make one, so we basically just smacked them together and we have a goofy and enjoyable theme.
                  <br><br>
                  This game is for 3 - 6 players. There are 4 decks of cards in the center: yellow donation cards, green building cards, purple seance cards, and red milestone cards. Donation, building, and seance cards go into the players' hands, while milestone cards always stay on the table. Players would start with 1 of each card in their hand except for milestone cards. Donation and Building cards are paid for with fly tokens and will be played in front of the player. Donation cards generate fly tokens, while building cards would generate anything else, likegetting more followers, drawing more cards, getting more action points etc. Those cards have different effects that trigger at different times and conditions. Players would want to find cards that synergise with each other and thus build their engine to generate resources.
                  <br>
                  There are also white cubes and green cubes provided and they are action cubes and follower cubes respectively. Some actions require players to use a white action cube along other resources, such as buying more action cubes, gain a new follower, draw a new card etc. Players start with 3 of them, and can buy more or gain from card effects. Action cubes are only used and not discarded, used action cubes will be available again on players' next turn.
                  <br>
                  Green follower cubes are used to play the purple seance cards, the last card type that goes into players' hands, or level up cards on the player's field. There are boxes on donation and building cards, and that's where the follower cubes belong, filling up each column from left to right to gain stronger card effects. Players would spend 1 action cube to place 1 follower cube onto a card. Playing seance cards would cost follower cubes <i>not</i> on a card, but they won't be sacrificed unless otherwise stated. They will just be used like action cubes, and would be available again next turn to cast more spells.
                  <br>
                  Lastly, at most 2 milestone cards are revealed to players at a time and they are goals that players would want to meet. Once the milestone is met, the player will claim the milestone and a new one will be flipped over on the next player's turn. These cards' numbers correspond to player score. The first player to reach 10 milestone points gains the favor of their god wins the game.

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  This project is a group academic project of 6 people: Matthew Jacobs, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-sheikh-b47772192/" target="_blank">Zach Sheikh</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-siwanowicz-04a774192" target="_blank">Thomas Siwanowicz</a>, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/juliatennant" target="_blank">Julia Tennant</a>, Zhao Xuanang, and me. Julia is an illustrator that we asked help from later in development to help with finishing card illustrations. The rest of us 5 developed the game from start to finish, and running playtests to balance and tweak the game. I was also responsible for designing the fly tokens, solidifying card layout designs, card back illustrations, and over half of the card face illustrations.
                  <br>
                  We started with a paper prototype and just threw out card effect ideas, then printed them out. We first had internal playtests to smooth out the game mechanics and system, scrapping things like the follower deck, and iterating on the building and magic deck. When the game got a little more stable and playable, we brought it to Crash Test, which is a club at RIT that allows people to bring in tabletop game prototypes to be playtested. We hosted a multitude of tests, both local and blind playtests, and were able to collect a lot of feedback and helpful advice or suggestions players had. Then eventually the game evolved to now have simple follower cubes, and upgradable cards.
                  <br>
                  The development of the game was our main focus, and we decided to wait until our card effects were more stable and set before we made any artwork for them, since the card illustrations are based on the cards' names and effects. While this prevented us from having to scrap artwork, this caused us a huge time crunch for me and Matt, the artists of the team, to produce unique illustrations for 53 cards. I managed to illustrate all the donation and building card faces, 5 magic card faces, 9 milestone card faces, the 4 card types' card backs, and the fly tokens. Matt designed the box art and some of the card faces, and Julia really helped reduce our load by helping with the rest of the card illustrations. Despite several delays, we still managed to finish all the art in time for our manufacture order to arrive before we showcased it at ImagineRIT, then the semester end showcase for our class.
                  <br><br>
                  Illustrations were done using Krita, some layouts were done in Photoshop.
                </p>

                <h4>Current work</h4>
                <p>
                  Despite this being a class project, Thomas, Zach, Matt, and I felt that our game has potential and is genuinely fun to play, so we decided to contiue it's development and take it further. We are currently running a small public discord server to host playtests, and provide updates on our development. Thomas, Zach, and I have been meeting biweekly during the summer, hosting playtests on Friday night and collecting feedback, and then discussing and applying changes using that feedback on Monday nights, while Matt is developing a website for our game. We ported our game into Tabletop Simulator to allow all of us to host and join the tests remotely.
                  <br>
                  Our current new development progress with the game is that we have a bunch of new cards and effects being implemented and tested, that has more impact on players between their turn. Have a somewhat working solution on making earning milestone points less dependent on RNG. And our biggest fix we are trying to achieve currently is to properly reward players who successfully built an engine, since we have noticed a trend that our current system seems to favor players who earned a large sum of money in a short period of time, and subsequently buying a win without needing an engine at all.
                  <br><br>
                  We aren't nearly close to this step yet, but we aim to eventually publish this game of ours as a fully fledged and polished engine building game.

            Players would have to guess the right ingredient combinations to make potions requested by their customers based on the attributes and nature of provided ingredients and requested potions, then try and earn as money as they can before the end of the day.

                <h4>More about the game</h4>
                <p>
                  This game prototype was done in a little more than a month. It's setting and mechanics are based on
                  the Dresden Files univserse, specifically how potions are made in that universe as our game is about
                  making potions.
                  <br><br>
                  Players would have to guess the right ingredient combinations to make potions requested by their
                  customers based on the attributes and nature of provided ingredients and requested potions.
                  <br>
                  It will be confusing to start when the player is still trying to find the potion recipies. But once
                  the player gets them, it's all about speed and memory, to serve as many customers as possible to earn lots
                  of money by the end of the day. Then try to break their own highest records of cash earned.
                  <br><br>
                  Each ingredient is mapped to a key on the keyboard as indicated above the ingredient, so players will press the corresponding key to add that ingredient into the mixing bowl. The ingredients are also categorised into 8 types as indicated by the color of their name tag. It is because in the Dresden Files universe, potions are made with 8 ingredients: a liquid base, an ingredent for each of the 5 senses, one for the mind, and one for the spirit. Therefore, players can only add one of each type of ingredent into the bowl.
                  <br>
                  The potion needs to be mixed after 8 ingredients are added into the bowl, and it is done by holding down spacebar. It would simply not work if not enough ingredients are added. Once the mixture is stirred, players can tell what kind of potion they made by the color the mixture is. If that was not the potion the current customer needs or if the player added a wrong ingredient, they could press spacebar to start over. If the player did make the right potion, they will press enter to transfer the liquid into the flask on the right to shove magic into it. The white line on the bar under the flask will move across the bar, and players would preferrably want to stop it in the green zone by pressing enter again. If it lands in the green zone, it makes a great potion and customers will pay more; if it lands in the yellow, the potion is subpar and customers will pay a little less; if it goes over to the red, the player is using magic recklessly and customers will pay even less. If players served the wrong potion to the customer, they will lose some money, however if the customer left after waiting for too long, players won't loose anything.

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  This project is a group academic project of 4 people: <a href="https://patrickode.github.io/" target="_blank">Patrick Mitchell</a>, <a
                    href="https://crlimacastro.github.io/" target="_blank">Camilo Lima</a>, <a
                    href="http://rhysstever.me/" target="_blank">Rhys Stever</a>, and me. I was responsible for making
                  all of the art and assets for this project, then implementing them as spritesheets in Unity.
                  <br>
                  We were required to submit box art for our prototype even if it's PC only. So we were allowed to
                  choose a different platform that does distrubute games with physical boxes and design one for that, thus a
                  PS4 box art for our PC game.
                  <br><br>
                  There are 24 ingredient types on the table, and they each have their own "piece image" asset that
                  appears in the mixing bowl. The stirred mixture is a white and grey image placed in between the front
                  and back of the bowl assets, then tinted in game to reflect the type of potion made by the player. The
                  table is made with help of texture stamps to reflect their material types.
                  <br>
                  The customers all have the same figure, in the same cloak with different colors, then mix and matched
                  4 types of skin color, hair styles, and eyes. This was done because I was running out of time to make
                  more varied assets by the end of the project, so we had to settle with similar looking customers instead of
                  a diverse cast. The cloak also unfortunately wasn't the best clothing style for this game's people,
                  since the Dresden Files universe is set in the modern US.
                  <br><br>
                  The menu art was based on the idea that this potion shop the player runs is located underground. So I
                  imagined that the shop is in some secret underground facility with a bunch of corridors, where other
                  magic users could rent out the rooms provided there and do whatever they please. And the menu art is
                  the door to the shop, with it's name and some art spray painted onto the wall and door directly.
                  <br>
                  It was really hard to find reference images that had indoor storefronts that don't have any windows,
                  since we decided that the shop wouldn't have windows for being underground. Or just underground
                  facilities that had the right feel or elements I wanted to find in general. I found exactly 1 image of
                  a door to a bar down a corridor with minimal wall art that expressed some liveliness and gave me the
                  right vibe for an underground society that isn't abandoned.
                  <br><br>
                  A rainbow potion being poured into a bottle while magic is shoved into it, depicted by the cyan and
                  purple particles and aura, is the design of the box art. The idea of "rainbow potion being poured into
                  a bottle" was suggested by Patrick since it is a simplier design, and we were running out of time to finish the project when I got to designing it. I took his suggestion and thought of the last step of making the potion: shoving magic into it. This highlights the magical aspect of the game and make an eye-catching design, and was how the design came to be.
                  <br><br>
                  All the art is done using Krita.

                <h4>More about the game</h4>
                <p>
                  This game prototype was done in a month. It's setting and mechanics are based on the Ethshar universe,
                  specifically theurgy as the form of magic that the player character uses. Some enemies are also cannonical creatures in the Ethshar universe, such as the treesquid.
                  <br><br>
                  WoodWhisked is a tile based, casual adventure puzzle game. Players would have to navigate to the end
                  tile, which is a cyan colored rune, to complete the level and proceed to the next. Along the way there
                  would be enemies, like the boar and the treesquid, that would hurt the player on contact and restart
                  the
                  level. Players would have to utilise their remaining arrows from their hunting trip, and their theurgy
                  abilities to safely navigate the forest and reach their end goal.
                  <br><br>
                  Our game is also turn based, where enemies will not make their turn until the player does, therefore
                  the
                  player can take their time to think of their next moves, and observe enemy behaviour and movement
                  patterns. Boars will move 1 tile every 2 turns and try to ram into the player, while the tree squid is
                  stationary. Originally it was planned that the treesquid would hide in their tree until the player
                  gets
                  close enough, then attack the player when they are in the tiles adjacent to the tree. However we ran
                  out
                  of time to implement that.
                  <br><br>
                  Currently we have implemented 4 levels, 2 enemy types, shooting arrows, and 1 theurgy ability. There
                  were more enemies and theurgy abilities planned during development, but we weren't able to implement
                  all
                  of them due to the time constrain. Entities are also unfortunately unanimated.
                </p>

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  This project is a group academic project of 4 people: <a href="https://patrickode.github.io/" target="_blank">Patrick Mitchell</a>, <a
                    href="https://crlimacastro.github.io/" target="_blank">Camilo Lima</a>, <a
                    href="http://rhysstever.me/" target="_blank">Rhys Stever</a>, and me. I was responsible for making
                  all of the art and assets for
                  this project, then implementing them as spritesheets in Unity.
                  <br>
                  We were required to submit box art for our prototype even if it's PC only. So we were allowed to
                  choose
                  a different platform that does distrubute games with physical boxes and design one for that, thus a
                  PS4
                  box art for our PC game.
                  <br><br>
                  All the tiles in the game are 64px squares. Grass and path tiles all connect with each other
                  seamlessly.
                  The flora consists of 2 types of trees, tree stumps, fallen logs, and bushes. Due to the time
                  constrain,
                  and this being a prototype, these tile assets are rather simple and has no shading done on them so I
                  could save time and get them done as quickly as possible.
                  <br>
                  The entities have more detail though, especially the player character, where their design has to
                  reflect
                  that they are a theurgist hunter. The white handprint on their hood and quiver, alongside the gold
                  trim
                  of their robe are what theurgists wear in the Ethshar universe. Though as a hunter, they would have to
                  blend into the environment as well, thus their robe being green instead of white. The player
                  character's
                  design was a fun mix and match of 2 roles and their respective attire and symbols.
                  <br><br>
                  Rune tiles were designed with reference to magic circles and rune symbols. The end tile had a bunch of
                  symbols drawn in it that mostly relate to "teleportation", "nature", "wind", and "home". That's
                  because
                  the player character wishes to find their way out of the forest and back home, and a change of
                  location
                  (to next level) suggests teleportation of some sort. The green "pressure plate" rune was mostly
                  designed
                  on the idea of an eye, where it's like something is awakened and it opens its eyes. But since it's a
                  rune, they are drawings or inscriptions, so the eye doesn't open or close, but the glowing parts
                  reflect
                  its current state instead.
                  <br><br>
                  Ability icons on the top left have 2 different outline colors because of their different nature. Using
                  your bow and arrow is a normal physical skill, so it has a plain black outline. While the leap
                  ability,
                  along with 2 other unimplemented abilities, have a light yellow outline that has a bit of an inner
                  glow
                  to show that they are theurgy abilities and relating to magic.
                  <br>
                  The buttons were also designed by me, and they are a 9-sliced sprite. They are designed to look fancy,
                  are green and gold to reflect the player character's robe colors, and look like vines of a sort due to
                  the game's setting in a magical forest.
                  <br><br>
                  The menu art is of the forest the player character is situated in: a dense and mysterious forest. The
                  box art features the player, a hidden treesquid, and an unimplemented enemy called a mizagar, where
                  only
                  its red menacing eyes are seen. Mizagars are another cannonical creature in the Ethshar universe, and
                  would have been a great and challenging enemy to face, but as mentioned above, we didn't have the time
                  to implement it, so I added it to the box design as an homage.
                  <br>
                  A mizagar is said to be really hard to detect, and nearly invisible at night, therefore only their
                  eyes
                  were drawn in the design. Humans are also their preferred food, thus I made the eyes menacing, to show
                  that they are a threat to the player character. While the mizagar isn't in our prototype, having it in
                  the box art as a lurking danger better reflects the tone and mood of our game, and letting potential
                  consumers know what they're getting into whie looking at the game box to decide whether or not to buy
                  it.
                  <br>
                  One small unfortunate note about the box art though, I was rushing to complete it and in the heat of
                  it
                  forgot to add the game name to the spine.
                  <br><br>
                  All the art is done using Krita.

            We were tasked to make an audio visualizer for this project, where users can control some of the visual and
            audio effects. Then we decided to gamify it, and make it play similar to the game Just Shapes and Beats.

                <h4>More about the project</h4>
                <p>
                  Currently there are 3 tracks for selection, and each track has differnet visual elements. Visual
                  elements include poppers, blips, moving Bezier curves, and audio data.
                  <br>
                  Bars are used to present audio data, and users can pick between viewing the music's frequencies or
                  waveform. It is shown on all 3 tracks, is behind and slightly dimmer than other visual elements.
                  <br>
                  Poppers will constantly bounce around the screen, their size changes with a randomly selected
                  frequency
                  data node, and if cooldown is up they will pop and spawn blips if the frequency is high enough or if
                  the
                  previous value has large enough of a different than the current one.
                  <br>
                  Blips are just small circles or squares that move across the screen in a single direction and speed
                  until they move off screen, then they disappear.
                  <br>
                  Moving Bezier curves can be either a regular Bezier curve or a quadradic Bezier curve. Their start and
                  end points are stationary, but their control points will move and bounce around the screen, their
                  speed
                  varying with the waveform audio data, producing Bezier curves that change shape with the music.
                  <br>
                  The first track consists of 2 poppers, a square and a circle one; The second track consists of 1
                  circle
                  popper, and blips spawning from the right size of the canvas if the audio data has a high average; the
                  third track consists of 5 quadradic Bezier curves in the center and 2 regular Bezier curves on the
                  sides, along with a surprise.
                  <br><br>
                  Controls are provided to the user, it can be opened and collasped in the top right corner, and they
                  can
                  pick which music track they want to listen to, adjust the volume, visual effects, and audio effects,
                  and
                  pick which audio data to view.
                  <br>
                  Visual effects include changing the color scheme, have the color scheme be a gradient or not, toggle
                  noise, invert colors, and show an emboss effect. Audio effects including adjusting the bass or treble
                  effect, and toggle distortion. Unfortunately, the distortion toggle does not work because we ran out
                  of
                  time to figure it out.
                  <br><br>
                  One last control is the gamify toggle, which will turn the Audio Visualizer into Just Visuals and
                  Audio,
                  mimicking the music bullet hell game Just Shapes and Beats. However, this portion is notoriously
                  unfinished, and frankly isn't a game yet. The toggle changes the heading of the page, adds a player
                  select and stats below the play / pause button, adds a player shape to the canvas that follows the
                  cursor, and freezes everything on the canvas when the music is paused, but that's all we managed to
                  complete before the submission deadline.
                  <br>
                  This was totally the case of us biting off way more than we could chew, but also it was around the
                  time
                  when Covid-19 lockdowns started getting issued, and we all had to quickly switch to working completely
                  remotely. So with all that extra stress happening, we couldn't get around to implement collision
                  detection, which is the one and main thing that makes it a game.
                  <br>
                  We were planning to have keyboard controls and have a dash just like Just Shapes and Beats, but we
                  couldn't figure out how to implement keyboard inputs at the time, so we quickly switched to having the cursor be the
                  player. We added the player stats so that players could see how many
                  hits they took and how many dashes they did, and a ranking system based on the number of hits players
                  took. But as mentioned above, collision detection wasn't even implemented, so none of these stats
                  could
                  be properly shown.
                </p>

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  We worked in pairs for this academic project, and both of us had to work on all parts of this project
                  equally. My
                  friend <a href="https://people.rit.edu/jsh7099/portfolio/" target="_blank">Joseph</a> and I
                  contributed
                  to the coding, working on different classes and files at the same time. The idea of making a game out of an audio visualizer and picking Just Shapes and Beats as the game to
                  mimick was my idea, since I thoroughly enjoyed that game, and got really excited at the thought that
                  we
                  could make something like that. (And thus got way too ambitious.)
                  <br>
                  I was more experienced with the mechanics of Just Shapes and Beats, so I guided Joseph on what kind
                  of visual elements we could add to this project, namely the poppers and blips. The Bezier curves were
                  a
                  fun addition suggested by Joseph while we were wondering what simplier shape or element we could
                  easily add and clearly represent the audio data. Then I suggested we move the curves' control points
                  around the screen since I did that in a different assignment and had a lot of fun with it.
                  <br>
                  There is a lot of code in this project, some given by our professor, a bunch taken and refactored from
                  our past projects, and a lot we figured out along the way. There's no clear differentiation on which
                  parts of the code each of us did, since we did paired programming and helped each other out a lot of
                  the
                  times as well. I believe the only thing that was done separately was me rushing to write the css to
                  make
                  the page resemble Just Shapes and Beats, while Joseph rushed to write the documentation for our
                  project before submission.
                  <br><br>
                  This project was done entirely with Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and with help of the Canvas API, Web
                  Audio API, and dat.GUI API.

            In this project we had to use the phyllotaxis mathematical formula to create an artistic interactive
            experience. Users can click to create sprials on the canvas, and have a multitude of controls to change how
            the sprials grow on the fly.

            Users can generate flowers will different sizes, colors, petal shapes, lines, and sprial patterns. Each flower could keep a single unchanged design, or mix and match the above listed parameters.

                <h4>More about the project</h4>
                <p>
                  Phyllotaxis is related to botany and refers to the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, it is also
                  seen in plants that grow in sprial patterns. This project uses one of the mathematical formula
                  proposed
                  by Vogel to obtain the polar coordinates of successive florets, where the divergence angle would
                  determine what pattern would result.
                  <br><br>
                  Users will click on the canvas and a sprial will start growing from that point, and there can be
                  multiple flowers / sprials growing at once. Controls include flower size, petal padding, petal size,
                  divergence angle, petal shape and color, and toggle lines drawn between petals and their color. Users
                  can also pause and play the growth of flowers, change the background color of the canvas, save their
                  creations to their computer, and reset the canvas.
                  <br>
                  Flower size affects the number of dots drawn in a spawned sprial; petal padding affects the space
                  between each petal; petal size is just the size of each dot. The divergence angle as mentioned above
                  is
                  what changes the type of sprial the dots will be drawn in. Changing the value of it by even 0.5 will
                  result in a completely different sprial pattern. By default petals are circles, but if users uncheck
                  that option they will get square petals, however they won't rotate based on their position. Lines are
                  unchecked by default, they are drawn from the previous dot to the next dot if checked. Both petals and
                  lines have a separate color picker for changing their color.
                  <br>
                  Some of these controls will affect flowers that are currently still growing on the canvas, so users
                  can
                  make a single flower have petals with multiple colors, shapes, lines and even change the type of
                  sprial
                  with the divergence angle halfway through. This is where the play pause buttons come in handy, where
                  users can pause the canvas and have all the time they needed to change the flower parameters, then
                  play
                  it again and see all the new changes at once. Flowers can still be initiated by clicking when the
                  canvas
                  is paused, however I did not think of having an indication for that during development. It was
                  suggested
                  to me after it was submitted that I could have drawn the first dot for the sprial when the canvas is
                  paused. So currently it would look like nothing happened when the canvas is clicked when it's paused,
                  then all the flowers will bloom together once the play button is pressed, and I understand this would
                  definitely confuse users at first.
                  <br>
                  Users can change the background image of the canvas, however it does not appear in the saved image if
                  users decided to download the image. It's because I changed the css styling of the canvas instead of
                  drawing the background onto the canvas directly, so the downloaded image will always have a
                  transparent
                  background regardless of what the user selected.

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  This is an individual academic project. There was some code that was given to us from the professor,
                  then I wrote the rest of the code by myself. The css styling for the custom radio buttons, checkboxes,
                  and slider were code copied from w3schools, and I made the color palette of the page with help of
                  paletton.com. I had tried to not take w3school's code directly, however any modification to it besides
                  changing simple color hex codes and certain values would just break the entire thing. Therefore, I
                  only
                  changed the color of elements and left the code as is, then linked the source as comments in the css
                  file.
                  <br><br>
                  This project was done entirely with Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and with help of the Canvas API.
                  <br><br>

                  <br><br>
                  Bonus: I discovered if you check lines, make them a different color than the dots, then keep clicking
                  the same
                  exact spot in short intervals, it creates a really cool visual effect as you watch multiple flowers
                  grow
                  together in the same spot.
