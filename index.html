            One Brain Cell is a short game about incredibly stupid creatures made by a "totally normal scientist" trying their best to get to the bread in the center of the test chamber but also eating anything else they come across.
            <br>
            It is a game made for a game jam with 3 selected mechanics that participants would try their best to use or be inspired by for their game. To which I interpreted them as making a co-op game with tiles that break as you walk on them, and players lose more times than winning.

                <h4>More about the game</h4>
                <p>
                  One Brain Cell was made during the Wpring Game Jam hosted by the Break My Game community. Participants had 2 weeks to make a game, and the selected mechanics this jam were no victories, map reduction, and advantage token.
                  <br><br>
                  This resulted in One Brain Cell, where players play as creatures created by a "totally normal scientist" and are really stupid, because they would eat anything they come across and share 1 collective brain cell. The scientist put the creatures into their test chamber to see how they fair against eating different types of "foods" and whatever they decide to throw at them.
                  <br><br>
                  The game goes for 2 - 4 players, and players / creatures start on the 4 corners of the rectangular hex grid representing the test chamber. The 7 tiles in the center have bread, and the creatures would try their best to move to it because bread is the only food that would satiate their endless hunger. Most tiles have limited durability and would break behind creatures as they walk along them. Any "food" they eat might have an immediate effect, and all foods that are later discharged from their bodies would have another effect. The advantage token is a literal brain cell that's passed around between players that would allow them to perform 1 of few special actions for the round. For example, spit out some planks to cover up a hole if they have consumed some logs. 1 event card is also drawn after every round to see what the scientist decided to test the creatures with.
                  <br><br>
                  On the first iteration shown in the 3rd image, the whole map had to be assembled tile by tile randomly with the 3 tile type, then also place all the food items in. It made set up time really long and tedious and is especially bad for a game that is intended to be a quick death game. So all tiles start off unknown in the second iteration, which makes set up just be removing everything from the mat and placing the meeples on the 4 corners. Event cards were also added to add another type of randomness to the game, and also brings in the presence of the scientist more. The meeples were also changed to be directional, and would point in the direction of where creatures are moving in. The direction would be important for some of the foods' effects as to which tile relative to the creature's direction would it go onto.
                </p>

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  I made 3 different tile types with different durabilities, using different amounts of lines and color for players to easily differentiate them. There's also a cracked texture tile that is transparent, and it is made to be placed on top of tiles with more durability than 1. This way players can track which tiles have been traversed on before, and know that the tile now only has 1 durability left and is about to break.
                  <br><br> 
                  The planks and glue splatter both used to be special tiles that are uniquely shaped, because they were the only 2 kinds of special tiles that would modify other tiles. But then they were placed on the back side of the food tile tokens, because the rest of the available food items all have an effect after being discharged from a creature's body. In addition, the food tiles are just directly drawn from a hidden box in iteration 2 instead of laid out face down on the map on iteration 1, so the mystery food symbol with the '?' is no longer needed.
                  <br><br>
                  Then the event cards are designed with a sci-fi aesthetic since the theme and setting of the game is in a scientist's laboratory test chamber. I imagined that the event cards are data logs from the scientist noting down their observations of how the creatures reacted to their tests. Therefore the cards also resemble creature entry logs from other sci-fi games, and I added a little personal note from the scientist at the bottom right to help with that immersion.
                  <br><br>
                  The rest of the components are built in components provided by Tabletop Playground, which is the tabletop game tool I'm using to make this game with. It has an editor that allows me to import the art assets I made for the jam and set them to be different types of hex tiles, and make a custom deck of cards for the event deck. It also provided the boxes, dice, counters, meeples, and table that the game is placed on. All assets are made in Krita by me (except for the blob fish image which is a creative commons licensed image).

                <h4>More about the game</h4>
                <p>
                  Leap of Faith is an engine building card game for 2 - 4 players. Players play as frog leaders of their own cults. They will compete to build the best cult ever to generate the most resources to appease the God, for there is a calamity rapidly approaching. A fire that will soon wipe their entire existence, so best to be the first to appease the God and gain their favor: a grant for mass ascension, and escape the otherwise firey demise.
                  <br><br>
                  Players each have a player board representing the common area of their cult. It shows actions that players can take using their Followers in their cult, and their cult's Influence and Suspicion. The rest of their play area, typically the table space to the right of the player board, is where the cult's functional buildings are erected, aka the cards that form your resource generation engine. Players can also upgrade their cards permanently by assigning Followers onto the cards too. There's currently 2 types of cards in the game: Donation cards that generate Fly Tokens, the currency of the game; and Building cards that attract new Followers to your cult passively. They are drawn from the center Devotion board. The Devotion board also holds Cult-Milestones provided by the God. Completing them will advance players on the Devotion track also found on the Devotion board. Any player reaching at least 50 Devotion, or if the round counter reaches 12, the game will end and the final tally begins. The player with the highest Final Devotion gains the favor of the God, is granted ascension, and wins the game.
                </p>

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  This started off as a class project where 6 of us contributed to different parts of it, and had 1 physical copy of the prototype manufactured. Afterwards, 3 of us decided to continue to work on the game for a short while. And now I am the current solo developer of this tabletop game.
                  <br><br>
                  Since the prorotype version that came out of our class, we have expanded on the player board to what it is today, and continuously changed and tweaked card effects and number balances. There exists the Devotion board now, and the scoring system has undergone a few changes. There used to be a third deck the functions differently than the other 2 decks, but they've continuously caused issues one way or another, and is hard to balance. So eventually I removed it entirely, also because the game is fully functional without them just fine. Though I would like to try and add them back under the same name but with an entirely different function later on.
                  <br><br>
                  I've joined a few online board game communities to be able to playtest the ongoing development of the game. I also currently manage the Instagram and Facebook page regarding the development of the game as well. There's also new looks and designs for the cards currently, although the card art is temporary, since they are made from creative commons licensed images edited together. Those would have to remade at a later date as not all the images I found could be used commercially, and I'd like to properly make some nice art for them once the mechanics are a bit more stable anyways. All of the new art seen on the components are made by me in Krita, though the box art seen on the entry thumbnail is still the previously used art done by Matt while we were in class.
                  <br><br>
                  The game is also digitised to facilitate online playtesting and is available on both Tabletop Playground and Tabletop Simulator. The shown images are taken from Tabletop Playground, which is the main tabletop game tool I'm using.

                <h4>More about the game</h4>
                <p>
                  This game prototype was done in a little more than a month. It's setting and mechanics are based on
                  the Dresden Files univserse, specifically how potions are made in that universe as our game is about
                  making potions.
                  <br><br>
                  Players would have to guess the right ingredient combinations to make potions requested by their
                  customers based on the attributes and nature of provided ingredients and requested potions.
                  <br>
                  It will be confusing to start when the player is still trying to find the potion recipies. But once
                  the player gets them, it's all about speed and memory, to serve as many customers as possible to earn lots
                  of money by the end of the day. Then try to break their own highest records of cash earned.
                  <br><br>
                  Each ingredient is mapped to a key on the keyboard as indicated above the ingredient, so players will press the corresponding key to add that ingredient into the mixing bowl. The ingredients are also categorised into 8 types as indicated by the color of their name tag. It is because in the Dresden Files universe, potions are made with 8 ingredients: a liquid base, an ingredent for each of the 5 senses, one for the mind, and one for the spirit. Therefore, players can only add one of each type of ingredent into the bowl.
                  <br>
                  The potion needs to be mixed after 8 ingredients are added into the bowl, and it is done by holding down spacebar. It would simply not work if not enough ingredients are added. Once the mixture is stirred, players can tell what kind of potion they made by the color the mixture is. If that was not the potion the current customer needs or if the player added a wrong ingredient, they could press spacebar to start over. If the player did make the right potion, they will press enter to transfer the liquid into the flask on the right to shove magic into it. The white line on the bar under the flask will move across the bar, and players would preferrably want to stop it in the green zone by pressing enter again. If it lands in the green zone, it makes a great potion and customers will pay more; if it lands in the yellow, the potion is subpar and customers will pay a little less; if it goes over to the red, the player is using magic recklessly and customers will pay even less. If players served the wrong potion to the customer, they will lose some money, however if the customer left after waiting for too long, players won't loose anything.

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  This project is a group academic project of 4 people: <a href="https://patrickode.github.io/" target="_blank">Patrick Mitchell</a>, <a
                    href="https://crlimacastro.github.io/" target="_blank">Camilo Lima</a>, <a
                    href="http://rhysstever.me/" target="_blank">Rhys Stever</a>, and me. I was responsible for making
                  all of the art and assets for this project, then implementing them as spritesheets in Unity.
                  <br>
                  We were required to submit box art for our prototype even if it's PC only. So we were allowed to
                  choose a different platform that does distrubute games with physical boxes and design one for that, thus a
                  PS4 box art for our PC game.
                  <br><br>
                  There are 24 ingredient types on the table, and they each have their own "piece image" asset that
                  appears in the mixing bowl. The stirred mixture is a white and grey image placed in between the front
                  and back of the bowl assets, then tinted in game to reflect the type of potion made by the player. The
                  table is made with help of texture stamps to reflect their material types.
                  <br>
                  The customers all have the same figure, in the same cloak with different colors, then mix and matched
                  4 types of skin color, hair styles, and eyes. This was done because I was running out of time to make
                  more varied assets by the end of the project, so we had to settle with similar looking customers instead of
                  a diverse cast. The cloak also unfortunately wasn't the best clothing style for this game's people,
                  since the Dresden Files universe is set in the modern US.
                  <br><br>
                  The menu art was based on the idea that this potion shop the player runs is located underground. So I
                  imagined that the shop is in some secret underground facility with a bunch of corridors, where other
                  magic users could rent out the rooms provided there and do whatever they please. And the menu art is
                  the door to the shop, with it's name and some art spray painted onto the wall and door directly.
                  <br>
                  It was really hard to find reference images that had indoor storefronts that don't have any windows,
                  since we decided that the shop wouldn't have windows for being underground. Or just underground
                  facilities that had the right feel or elements I wanted to find in general. I found exactly 1 image of
                  a door to a bar down a corridor with minimal wall art that expressed some liveliness and gave me the
                  right vibe for an underground society that isn't abandoned.
                  <br><br>
                  A rainbow potion being poured into a bottle while magic is shoved into it, depicted by the cyan and
                  purple particles and aura, is the design of the box art. The idea of "rainbow potion being poured into
                  a bottle" was suggested by Patrick since it is a simplier design, and we were running out of time to finish the project when I got to designing it. I took his suggestion and thought of the last step of making the potion: shoving magic into it. This highlights the magical aspect of the game and make an eye-catching design, and was how the design came to be.
                  <br><br>
                  All the art is done using Krita.

                <h4>More about the game</h4>
                <p>
                  This game prototype was done in a month. It's setting and mechanics are based on the Ethshar universe,
                  specifically theurgy as the form of magic that the player character uses. Some enemies are also cannonical creatures in the Ethshar universe, such as the treesquid.
                  <br><br>
                  WoodWhisked is a tile based, casual adventure puzzle game. Players would have to navigate to the end
                  tile, which is a cyan colored rune, to complete the level and proceed to the next. Along the way there
                  would be enemies, like the boar and the treesquid, that would hurt the player on contact and restart
                  the
                  level. Players would have to utilise their remaining arrows from their hunting trip, and their theurgy
                  abilities to safely navigate the forest and reach their end goal.
                  <br><br>
                  Our game is also turn based, where enemies will not make their turn until the player does, therefore
                  the
                  player can take their time to think of their next moves, and observe enemy behaviour and movement
                  patterns. Boars will move 1 tile every 2 turns and try to ram into the player, while the tree squid is
                  stationary. Originally it was planned that the treesquid would hide in their tree until the player
                  gets
                  close enough, then attack the player when they are in the tiles adjacent to the tree. However we ran
                  out
                  of time to implement that.
                  <br><br>
                  Currently we have implemented 4 levels, 2 enemy types, shooting arrows, and 1 theurgy ability. There
                  were more enemies and theurgy abilities planned during development, but we weren't able to implement
                  all
                  of them due to the time constrain. Entities are also unfortunately unanimated.
                </p>

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  This project is a group academic project of 4 people: <a href="https://patrickode.github.io/" target="_blank">Patrick Mitchell</a>, <a
                    href="https://crlimacastro.github.io/" target="_blank">Camilo Lima</a>, <a
                    href="http://rhysstever.me/" target="_blank">Rhys Stever</a>, and me. I was responsible for making
                  all of the art and assets for
                  this project, then implementing them as spritesheets in Unity.
                  <br>
                  We were required to submit box art for our prototype even if it's PC only. So we were allowed to
                  choose
                  a different platform that does distrubute games with physical boxes and design one for that, thus a
                  PS4
                  box art for our PC game.
                  <br><br>
                  All the tiles in the game are 64px squares. Grass and path tiles all connect with each other
                  seamlessly.
                  The flora consists of 2 types of trees, tree stumps, fallen logs, and bushes. Due to the time
                  constrain,
                  and this being a prototype, these tile assets are rather simple and has no shading done on them so I
                  could save time and get them done as quickly as possible.
                  <br>
                  The entities have more detail though, especially the player character, where their design has to
                  reflect
                  that they are a theurgist hunter. The white handprint on their hood and quiver, alongside the gold
                  trim
                  of their robe are what theurgists wear in the Ethshar universe. Though as a hunter, they would have to
                  blend into the environment as well, thus their robe being green instead of white. The player
                  character's
                  design was a fun mix and match of 2 roles and their respective attire and symbols.
                  <br><br>
                  Rune tiles were designed with reference to magic circles and rune symbols. The end tile had a bunch of
                  symbols drawn in it that mostly relate to "teleportation", "nature", "wind", and "home". That's
                  because
                  the player character wishes to find their way out of the forest and back home, and a change of
                  location
                  (to next level) suggests teleportation of some sort. The green "pressure plate" rune was mostly
                  designed
                  on the idea of an eye, where it's like something is awakened and it opens its eyes. But since it's a
                  rune, they are drawings or inscriptions, so the eye doesn't open or close, but the glowing parts
                  reflect
                  its current state instead.
                  <br><br>
                  Ability icons on the top left have 2 different outline colors because of their different nature. Using
                  your bow and arrow is a normal physical skill, so it has a plain black outline. While the leap
                  ability,
                  along with 2 other unimplemented abilities, have a light yellow outline that has a bit of an inner
                  glow
                  to show that they are theurgy abilities and relating to magic.
                  <br>
                  The buttons were also designed by me, and they are a 9-sliced sprite. They are designed to look fancy,
                  are green and gold to reflect the player character's robe colors, and look like vines of a sort due to
                  the game's setting in a magical forest.
                  <br><br>
                  The menu art is of the forest the player character is situated in: a dense and mysterious forest. The
                  box art features the player, a hidden treesquid, and an unimplemented enemy called a mizagar, where
                  only
                  its red menacing eyes are seen. Mizagars are another cannonical creature in the Ethshar universe, and
                  would have been a great and challenging enemy to face, but as mentioned above, we didn't have the time
                  to implement it, so I added it to the box design as an homage.
                  <br>
                  A mizagar is said to be really hard to detect, and nearly invisible at night, therefore only their
                  eyes
                  were drawn in the design. Humans are also their preferred food, thus I made the eyes menacing, to show
                  that they are a threat to the player character. While the mizagar isn't in our prototype, having it in
                  the box art as a lurking danger better reflects the tone and mood of our game, and letting potential
                  consumers know what they're getting into whie looking at the game box to decide whether or not to buy
                  it.
                  <br>
                  One small unfortunate note about the box art though, I was rushing to complete it and in the heat of
                  it
                  forgot to add the game name to the spine.
                  <br><br>
                  All the art is done using Krita.

            We were tasked to make an audio visualizer for this project, where users can control some of the visual and
            audio effects. Then we decided to gamify it, and make it play similar to the game Just Shapes and Beats.
            <br>
            Currently there are 3 tracks for selection, and each track has differnet visual elements. Visual elements include poppers, blips, moving Bezier curves, and audio data.

                <h4>More about the project</h4>
                <p>
                  Currently there are 3 tracks for selection, and each track has differnet visual elements. Visual
                  elements include poppers, blips, moving Bezier curves, and audio data.
                  <br>
                  Bars are used to present audio data, and users can pick between viewing the music's frequencies or
                  waveform. It is shown on all 3 tracks, is behind and slightly dimmer than other visual elements.
                  <br>
                  Poppers will constantly bounce around the screen, their size changes with a randomly selected
                  frequency
                  data node, and if cooldown is up they will pop and spawn blips if the frequency is high enough or if
                  the
                  previous value has large enough of a different than the current one.
                  <br>
                  Blips are just small circles or squares that move across the screen in a single direction and speed
                  until they move off screen, then they disappear.
                  <br>
                  Moving Bezier curves can be either a regular Bezier curve or a quadradic Bezier curve. Their start and
                  end points are stationary, but their control points will move and bounce around the screen, their
                  speed
                  varying with the waveform audio data, producing Bezier curves that change shape with the music.
                  <br>
                  The first track consists of 2 poppers, a square and a circle one; The second track consists of 1
                  circle
                  popper, and blips spawning from the right size of the canvas if the audio data has a high average; the
                  third track consists of 5 quadradic Bezier curves in the center and 2 regular Bezier curves on the
                  sides, along with a surprise.
                  <br><br>
                  Controls are provided to the user, it can be opened and collasped in the top right corner, and they
                  can
                  pick which music track they want to listen to, adjust the volume, visual effects, and audio effects,
                  and
                  pick which audio data to view.
                  <br>
                  Visual effects include changing the color scheme, have the color scheme be a gradient or not, toggle
                  noise, invert colors, and show an emboss effect. Audio effects including adjusting the bass or treble
                  effect, and toggle distortion. Unfortunately, the distortion toggle does not work because we ran out
                  of
                  time to figure it out.
                  <br><br>
                  One last control is the gamify toggle, which will turn the Audio Visualizer into Just Visuals and
                  Audio,
                  mimicking the music bullet hell game Just Shapes and Beats. However, this portion is notoriously
                  unfinished, and frankly isn't a game yet. The toggle changes the heading of the page, adds a player
                  select and stats below the play / pause button, adds a player shape to the canvas that follows the
                  cursor, and freezes everything on the canvas when the music is paused, but that's all we managed to
                  complete before the submission deadline.
                  <br>
                  This was totally the case of us biting off way more than we could chew, but also it was around the
                  time
                  when Covid-19 lockdowns started getting issued, and we all had to quickly switch to working completely
                  remotely. So with all that extra stress happening, we couldn't get around to implement collision
                  detection, which is the one and main thing that makes it a game.
                  <br>
                  We were planning to have keyboard controls and have a dash just like Just Shapes and Beats, but we
                  couldn't figure out how to implement keyboard inputs at the time, so we quickly switched to having the cursor be the
                  player. We added the player stats so that players could see how many
                  hits they took and how many dashes they did, and a ranking system based on the number of hits players
                  took. But as mentioned above, collision detection wasn't even implemented, so none of these stats
                  could
                  be properly shown.
                </p>

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  We worked in pairs for this academic project, and both of us had to work on all parts of this project
                  equally. My
                  friend <a href="https://people.rit.edu/jsh7099/portfolio/" target="_blank">Joseph</a> and I
                  contributed
                  to the coding, working on different classes and files at the same time. The idea of making a game out of an audio visualizer and picking Just Shapes and Beats as the game to
                  mimick was my idea, since I thoroughly enjoyed that game, and got really excited at the thought that
                  we
                  could make something like that. (And thus got way too ambitious.)
                  <br>
                  I was more experienced with the mechanics of Just Shapes and Beats, so I guided Joseph on what kind
                  of visual elements we could add to this project, namely the poppers and blips. The Bezier curves were
                  a
                  fun addition suggested by Joseph while we were wondering what simplier shape or element we could
                  easily add and clearly represent the audio data. Then I suggested we move the curves' control points
                  around the screen since I did that in a different assignment and had a lot of fun with it.
                  <br>
                  There is a lot of code in this project, some given by our professor, a bunch taken and refactored from
                  our past projects, and a lot we figured out along the way. There's no clear differentiation on which
                  parts of the code each of us did, since we did paired programming and helped each other out a lot of
                  the
                  times as well. I believe the only thing that was done separately was me rushing to write the css to
                  make
                  the page resemble Just Shapes and Beats, while Joseph rushed to write the documentation for our
                  project before submission.
                  <br><br>
                  This project was done entirely with Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and with help of the Canvas API, Web

            In this project we had to use the phyllotaxis mathematical formula to create an artistic interactive
            experience. Users can click to create sprials on the canvas, and have a multitude of controls to change how
            the sprials grow on the fly.
            <br>
            Users can generate flowers will different sizes, colors, petal shapes, lines, and sprial patterns. Each flower could keep a single unchanged design, or mix and match the above listed parameters.

                <h4>More about the project</h4>
                <p>
                  Phyllotaxis is related to botany and refers to the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, it is also
                  seen in plants that grow in sprial patterns. This project uses one of the mathematical formula
                  proposed
                  by Vogel to obtain the polar coordinates of successive florets, where the divergence angle would
                  determine what pattern would result.
                  <br><br>
                  Users will click on the canvas and a sprial will start growing from that point, and there can be
                  multiple flowers / sprials growing at once. Controls include flower size, petal padding, petal size,
                  divergence angle, petal shape and color, and toggle lines drawn between petals and their color. Users
                  can also pause and play the growth of flowers, change the background color of the canvas, save their
                  creations to their computer, and reset the canvas.
                  <br>
                  Flower size affects the number of dots drawn in a spawned sprial; petal padding affects the space
                  between each petal; petal size is just the size of each dot. The divergence angle as mentioned above
                  is
                  what changes the type of sprial the dots will be drawn in. Changing the value of it by even 0.5 will
                  result in a completely different sprial pattern. By default petals are circles, but if users uncheck
                  that option they will get square petals, however they won't rotate based on their position. Lines are
                  unchecked by default, they are drawn from the previous dot to the next dot if checked. Both petals and
                  lines have a separate color picker for changing their color.
                  <br>
                  Some of these controls will affect flowers that are currently still growing on the canvas, so users
                  can
                  make a single flower have petals with multiple colors, shapes, lines and even change the type of
                  sprial
                  with the divergence angle halfway through. This is where the play pause buttons come in handy, where
                  users can pause the canvas and have all the time they needed to change the flower parameters, then
                  play
                  it again and see all the new changes at once. Flowers can still be initiated by clicking when the
                  canvas
                  is paused, however I did not think of having an indication for that during development. It was
                  suggested
                  to me after it was submitted that I could have drawn the first dot for the sprial when the canvas is
                  paused. So currently it would look like nothing happened when the canvas is clicked when it's paused,
                  then all the flowers will bloom together once the play button is pressed, and I understand this would
                  definitely confuse users at first.
                  <br>
                  Users can change the background image of the canvas, however it does not appear in the saved image if
                  users decided to download the image. It's because I changed the css styling of the canvas instead of
                  drawing the background onto the canvas directly, so the downloaded image will always have a
                  transparent
                  background regardless of what the user selected.
                </p>

                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  This is an individual academic project. There was some code that was given to us from the professor,
                  then I wrote the rest of the code by myself. The css styling for the custom radio buttons, checkboxes,
                  and slider were code copied from w3schools, and I made the color palette of the page with help of
                  paletton.com. I had tried to not take w3school's code directly, however any modification to it besides
                  changing simple color hex codes and certain values would just break the entire thing. Therefore, I
                  only
                  changed the color of elements and left the code as is, then linked the source as comments in the css
                  file.
                  <br><br>
                  This project was done entirely with Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and with help of the Canvas API.

                  Bonus: I discovered if you check lines, make them a different color than the dots, then keep clicking
                  the same
                  exact spot in short intervals, it creates a really cool visual effect as you watch multiple flowers
                  grow
                  together in the same spot.
