                  <h4>More about the game</h4>
                  <p>
                    This game prototype was done in a little more than a month. It's setting and mechanics are based on the Dresden Files univserse, specifically how potions are made in that universe as our game is about making potions.
                    <br><br>
                    Players would have to guess the right ingredient combinations to make potions requested by their customers based on the attributes and nature of provided ingredients and requested potions.
                    <br>
                    It will be confusing to start when the player is still trying to find the potion recipies. But once the player gets them, it's all about speed and memory, to serve as many customers as possible to earn lots of money by the end of the day. Then try to break their own highest records of cash earned.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>My work</h4>
                  <p>
                    This project is a group project of 4 people. I was responsible for making all of the art and assets for this project, then implementing them as spritesheets in Unity.
                    <br>
                    We were required to submit box art for our prototype even if it's PC only. So we were allowed to choose a different platform that does distrubute games with physical boxes and design one for that, thus a PS4 box art for our PC game.
                    <br><br>
                    There are 24 ingredient types on the table, and they each have their own "piece image" asset that appears in the mixing bowl. The stirred mixture is a white and grey image placed in between the front and back of the bowl assets, then tinted in game to reflect the type of potion made by the player. The table is made with help of texture stamps to reflect their material types.
                    <br>
                    The customers all have the same figure, in the same cloak with different colors, then mix and matched 4 types of skin color, hair styles, and eyes. This was done because I was running out of time to make more varied assets by the end of the project, so we had to settle with similar looking customers instead of a diverse cast. The cloak also unfortunately wasn't the best clothing style for this game's people, since the Dresden Files universe is set in the modern US.
                    <br><br>
                    The menu art was based on the idea that this potion shop the player runs is located underground. So I imagined that the shop is in some secret underground facility with a bunch of corridors, where other magic users could rent out the rooms provided there and do whatever they please. And the menu art is the door to the shop, with it's name and some art spray painted onto the wall and door directly.
                    <br>
                    It was really hard to find reference images that had indoor storefronts that don't have any windows, since we decided that the shop wouldn't have windows for being underground. Or just underground facilities that had the right feel or elements I wanted to find in general. I found exactly 1 image of a door to a bar down a corridor with minimal wall art that expressed some liveliness and gave me the right vibe for an underground society that isn't abandoned.
                    <br><br>
                    A rainbow potion being poured into a bottle while magic is shoved into it, depicted by the cyan and purple particles and aura, is the design of the box art. The idea of "rainbow potion being poured into a bottle" was suggested by my groupmate since it is a simplier design, and because he saw that I was struggling to keep up with my projects piling up by the end of the semester. I didn't have my own design thought of either, and was frankly getting burnt out due to the end of semester crunch. So I took that suggestion, added some magic to it since it's a big part of our game, and managed to make it look great in the end. I also have to admit, liquid surfaces are <i>quite the challenge</i> to shade.
                    <br><br>
                    All the art is done using Krita.

                  <h4>More about the game</h4>
                  <p>
                    This game prototype was done in a month. It's setting and mechanics are based on the Ethshar universe, specifically theurgy as the form of magic that the player character uses, and the treesquid as an enemy, which is a cannonical creature in the Ethshar universe.
                    <br><br>
                    WoodWhisked is a tile based, casual adventure puzzle game. Players would have to navigate to the end tile, which is a cyan colored rune, to complete the level and proceed to the next. Along the way there would be enemies, like the boar and the treesquid, that would hurt the player on contact and restart the level. Players would have to utilise their remaining arrows from their hunting trip, and their theurgy abilities to safely navigate the forest and reach their end goal.
                    <br><br>
                    Our game is also turn based, where enemies will not make their turn until the player does, therefore the player can take their time to think of their next moves, and observe enemy behaviour and movement patterns. Boars will move 1 tile every 2 turns and try to ram into the player, while the tree squid is stationary. Originally it was planned that the treesquid would hide in their tree until the player gets close enough, then attack the player when they are in the tiles adjacent to the tree. However we ran out of time to implement that.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently we have implemented 4 levels, 2 enemy types, shooting arrows, and 1 theurgy ability. There were more enemies and theurgy abilities planned during development, but we weren't able to implement all of them due to the time constrain. Entities are also unfortunately unanimated.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>My work</h4>
                  <p>
                    This project is a group project of 4 people. I was responsible for making all of the art and assets for this project, then implementing them as spritesheets in Unity.
                    <br>

                    <br><br>
                    All the tiles in the game are 64px squares. Grass and path tiles all connect with each other seamlessly. The flora consists of 2 types of trees, tree stumps, fallen logs, and bushes. Due to the time constrain, and this being a prototype, these tile assets are rather simple and has no shading done on them so I could save time and get them done as quickly as possible.
                    <br>
                    The entities have more detail though, especially the player character, where their design has to reflect that they are a theurgist hunter. The white handprint on their hood and quiver, alongside the gold trim of their robe are what theurgists wear in the Ethshar universe. Though as a hunter, they would have to blend into the environment as well, thus their robe being green instead of white. The player character's design was a fun mix and match of 2 roles and their respective attire and symbols.
                    <br><br>
                    Rune tiles were designed with reference to magic circles and rune symbols. The end tile had a bunch of symbols drawn in it that mostly relate to "teleportation", "nature", "wind", and "home". That's because the player character wishes to find their way out of the forest and back home, and a change of location (to next level) suggests teleportation of some sort. The green "pressure plate" rune was mostly designed on the idea of an eye, where it's like something is awakened and it opens its eyes. But since it's a rune, they are drawings or inscriptions, so the eye doesn't open or close, but the glowing parts reflect its current state instead.
                    <br><br>
                    Ability icons on the top left have 2 different outline colors because of their different nature. Using your bow and arrow is a normal physical skill, so it has a plain black outline. While the leap ability, along with 2 other unimplemented abilities, have a light yellow outline that has a bit of an inner glow to show that they are theurgy abilities and relating to magic.
                    <br>
                    The buttons were also designed by me, and they are a 9-sliced sprite. They are designed to look fancy, are green and gold to reflect the player character's robe colors, and look like vines of a sort due to the game's setting in a magical forest.
                    <br><br>
                    The menu art is of the forest the player character is situated in: a dense and mysterious forest. The box art features the player, a hidden treesquid, and an unimplemented enemy called a mizagar, where only its red menacing eyes are seen. Mizagars are another cannonical creature in the Ethshar universe, and would have been a great and challenging enemy to face, but as mentioned above, we didn't have the time to implement it, so I added it to the box design as an homage.
                    <br>
                    A mizagar is said to be really hard to detect, and nearly invisible at night, therefore only their eyes were drawn in the design. Humans are also their preferred food, thus I made the eyes menacing, to show that they are a threat to the player character. While the mizagar isn't in our prototype, having it in the box art as a lurking danger better reflects the tone and mood of our game, and letting potential consumers know what they're getting into whie looking at the game box to decide whether or not to buy it.
                    <br>
                    One small unfortunate note about the box art though, I was rushing to complete it and in the heat of it forgot to add the game name to the spine.
                    <br><br>
                    All the art is done using Krita.
