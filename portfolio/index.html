                        <h4>More about the game</h4>
                        <p>
                            This game prototype was done in a little more than a month. It's setting and mechanics are based on the Dresden Files univserse, specifically how potions are made in that universe as our game is about making potions.
                            <br>
                            Players would have to guess the right ingredient combinations to make potions requested by their customers based on the attributes and nature of provided ingredients and requested potions.
                            <br>
                            It will be confusing to start when the player is still trying to find the potion recipies. But once the player gets them, it's all about speed and memory, to serve as many customers as possible to earn lots of money by the end of the day. Then try to break their own highest records of cash earned.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>My work</h4>
                        <p>
                            This project is a group project of 4 people. I was responsible for making all of the art and assets for this project, then implementing them as spritesheets in Unity.
                            <br>
                            We were required to submit box art for our prototype even if it's PC only. So we were allowed to choose a different platform that does distrubute games with physical boxes and design one for that, thus a PS4 box art for our PC game.
                            <br>
                            There are 24 ingredient types on the table, and they each have their own "piece image" asset that appears in the mixing bowl. The stirred mixture is a white and grey image placed in between the front and back of the bowl assets, then tinted in game to reflect the type of potion made by the player. The table is made with help of texture stamps to reflect their material types.
                            <br>
                            The customers all have the same figure, in the same cloak with different colors, then mix and matched 4 types of skin color, hair styles, and eyes. This was done because I was running out of time to make more varied assets by the end of the project, so we had to settle with similar looking customers instead of a diverse cast. The cloak also unfortunately wasn't the best clothing style for this game's people, since the Dresden Files universe is set in the modern US.
                            <br>
                            The menu art was based on the idea that this potion shop the player runs is located underground. So I imagined that the shop is in some secret underground facility with a bunch of corridors, where other magic users could rent out the rooms provided there and do whatever they please. And the menu art is the door to the shop, with it's name and some art spray painted onto the wall and door directly.
                            <br>
                            It was really hard to find reference images that had indoor storefronts that don't have any windows, since we decided that the shop wouldn't have windows for being underground. Or just underground facilities that had the right feel or elements I wanted to find in general. I found exactly 1 image of a door to a bar down a corridor with minimal wall art that expressed some liveliness and gave me the right vibe for an underground society that isn't abandoned.
                            <br>
                            I drew everything using Krita.
